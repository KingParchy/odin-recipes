    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Widely regarded as the national dish of Jamaica, Ackee and Saltfish is a
      masterful balance of savory, salty, and delicate flavors. The star of the
      dish is the ackee, a tropical fruit that, when cooked, takes on a soft,
      creamy consistency similar to scrambled eggs. It is sautéed with flaked
      salt cod (which has been boiled down to remove excess salt), Scotch bonnet
      peppers, onions, and tomatoes. This combination creates a rich,
      umami-forward breakfast or brunch staple that is deeply embedded in
      Caribbean culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is rarely eaten alone and is traditionally served with "hard
      food" or fried accompaniments. As seen here, the meal is rounded out by
      fried dumplings—dense, golden-brown dough balls—and slices of ripe fried
      plantain. The sweetness of the caramelized plantains provides a perfect
      counterpoint to the saltiness of the fish, while the dumplings serve as
      the ideal vessel for soaking up the flavorful oils and spices from the
      main pan.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Protein:</strong> 500g (approx. 1 lb) Salted Codfish</li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Fruit:</strong> 24 fresh Ackee pods (carefully cleaned) or
        350g canned Ackee
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Render:</strong> 6 strips of bacon, sliced into small bits
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Aromatics:</strong> 1 medium yellow onion (diced), 2 scallions
        (sliced), and 1 Scotch Bonnet chili (minced and deseeded)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fresh Addition:</strong> 1 vine-ripened tomato, chopped</li>
      <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Hydrate the Fish:</strong> Begin by soaking the salted cod in
        cold water for 30 minutes to soften. Drain, then transfer to a pot with
        fresh water and bring to a rolling boil. Once the fish is tender, drain
        it and use a fork to flake the meat into small pieces, discarding any
        skin or bones. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ackee Prep:</strong> If using fresh fruit, extract the "pegs"
        from the pods. Remove the seeds and the red/pink membranes entirely.
        Briefly parboil the ackee in salted water until just tender, then drain
        immediately. If using canned, simply drain and rinse gently to keep the
        fruit intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build the Flavor:</strong> In a large skillet over medium heat,
        fry the bacon until the fat renders and it becomes crispy. Remove the
        excess fat, then toss in the onion, scallions, and Scotch Bonnet. Sauté
        until the vegetables are translucent and aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine and Finish:</strong> Carefully fold in the flaked cod,
        prepared ackee, and diced tomato. Season with black pepper and allow the
        mixture to simmer over low heat for roughly 5 minutes so the flavors can
        integrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service:</strong> Use a slotted spoon to plate the dish,
        ensuring excess oil stays in the pan. Accompany with traditional
        "festival" or golden fried dumplings.
      </li>
    </ol>
