    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jerk Chicken is a world-renowned dish defined by its bold, fiery, and
      aromatic flavor profile. The process begins with a "jerk" marinade or dry
      rub, traditionally built on a foundation of crushed allspice berries
      (pimento) and Scotch bonnet peppers. These are blended with scallions,
      fresh thyme, ginger, garlic, and warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to
      create a complex balance of heat, sweetness, and earthiness.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Protein:</strong> 2 whole fresh chickens, divided into
        quarters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Aromatic Base Paste</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon finely ground pimento (allspice)</li>
          <li>7 scallions, chopped into rounds</li>
          <li>3 Scotch Bonnet chilies (deseeded if preferred)</li>
          <li>3 plump garlic cloves, peeled</li>
          <li>4 sprigs of fresh thyme leaves</li>
          <li>5 fresh or 2 dried bay leaves, crushed</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Savory Reduction Glaze</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Reserved half-portion of the Base Paste</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons fresh ginger, finely grated</li>
          <li>3 cups (750ml) filtered water</li>
          <li>
            Thickening slurry: 3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons
            water
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Create the Paste:</strong> Combine the allspice, scallions,
        chilies, garlic, and herbs in a food processor. Blend the mixture until
        it reaches a uniform, pasty consistency, seasoning generously with salt
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marination:</strong> PJamaican lace the chicken pieces into a
        large resealable plastic bag. Work half of your prepared aromatic paste
        into the meat, ensuring every piece is well-coated. Seal the bag and
        allow it to marinate in the refrigerator—ideally overnight for maximum
        flavor depth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slow Roasting:</strong> Arrange the seasoned chicken on a baking
        tray and place in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F). Bake slowly for
        approximately 1 hour until the juices run clear and the skin is
        darkened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finishing the Glaze:</strong> Transfer the remaining half of the
        paste into a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in the grated ginger
        and water, bringing the liquid to a rolling boil. Dial the heat back to
        a simmer, whisk in the cornstarch slurry, and stir continuously until
        the sauce becomes glossy and thick.
