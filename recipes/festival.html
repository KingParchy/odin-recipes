    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jamaican "Festivals" are a beloved staple of island street food, most
      famous for being the essential companion to fried fish or jerk pork.
      Unlike a standard savory dumpling, a festival is defined by its distinct
      oblong shape and a subtle sweetness that comes from the addition of sugar
      and cornmeal. This sweetness serves a functional purpose, acting as a
      cooling counterpoint to the intense heat of Scotch bonnet-based dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The texture is the true hallmark of a well-made festival: the exterior
      should be crispy and golden-brown, while the inside remains soft and
      slightly dense. As shown in the photo, they are traditionally served hot
      and fresh, often resting on parchment paper to soak up the residual oil
      from the deep-frying process. They are simple to make but remain one of
      the most comforting elements of a traditional Jamaican "spread."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Grain:</strong> 1 cup (150g) yellow cornmeal (fine-ground
        works best)
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Structure:</strong> 3/4 cup (100g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sweetener:</strong> 1/4 cup (60g) light brown sugar, firmly
        packed
      </li>
      <li><strong>Rising Agent:</strong> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li><strong>Binding Agent:</strong> 1 large egg, whisked gently</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hydration:</strong> Roughly 1 cup (250ml) room-temperature water
      </li>
      <li><strong>For Frying:</strong> 2 cups (500ml) neutral vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Whisk the Base:</strong> In a medium mixing bowl, combine your
        cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the whisked
        egg, then gradually incorporate the water. You are looking for a soft,
        pliable dough that holds its shape without being overly sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the Festivals:</strong> Pinch off small, golf-ball-sized
        portions of the dough. Roll them between your palms to create the
        signature cigar or oval shape, roughly 4 to 5 inches long.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Deep Fry:</strong> Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot
        and heat until it reaches a high temperature. Carefully lower a few
        pieces of dough into the hot oil—do not overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3 to
        4 minutes, turning them occasionally until the crust is a deep, uniform
        golden-brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Transfer the festivals to a wire rack
        or paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve immediately while they still
        have that characteristic outer crunch.
      </li>
    </ol>
