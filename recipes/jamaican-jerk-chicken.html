    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jamaican Jerk Chicken is a world-renowned dish defined by its bold, fiery,
      and aromatic flavor profile. The process begins with a "jerk" marinade or
      dry rub, traditionally built on a foundation of crushed allspice berries
      (pimento) and Scotch bonnet peppers. These are blended with scallions,
      fresh thyme, ginger, garlic, and warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to
      create a complex balance of heat, sweetness, and earthiness.
